Genetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA shows the Komodo dragon to be the closest relative (sister taxon) of the Australian lace monitor (V. varius), with their common ancestor diverging from a lineage that gave rise to the crocodile monitor (Varanus salvadorii) of New Guinea.[17][18][19] A 2021 study showed that during the late Miocene, the ancestors of Komodo dragons had hybridized with the common ancestor of Australian sand monitors (V. spenceri, V. gouldii, V. rosenbergi and V. panoptes).[20][21][22]

Fossils from across Queensland demonstrate that the Komodo dragon was once present in Australia, with fossils spanning from the Early Pliocene (~3.8 million years ago) to the Middle Pleistocene,[1] with the youngest confirmed records of the species in Australia dating to at latest 330,000 years ago. In Australia, it coexisted with the even larger monitor species Varanus priscus also known as megalania, the largest terrestrial lizard ever.[23] The oldest records of the Komodo dragon on Flores date to around 1.4 million years ago, during the Early Pleistocene.[24] Additionally, Pleistocene fossils of Varanus found in Java and Timor may belong to the Komodo dragon.
